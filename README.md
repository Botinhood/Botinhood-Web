# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.}
Our goal in creating Botinhood was to create a stock trading app that increases capital gains through the use of algorithms.

{Provide a description of your team project. Describe how to use the software.}

# Development Environment

Botinhood was written in VS Code primarily using the JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS languages.
It utilizes the React and Nest JS libraries to build the web app. The app uses the Alpaca API to get recent stock data.
